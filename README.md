# Resume Ranker

## Overview

Resume Ranker is a machine learning–based project designed to automatically evaluate and rank resumes based on their relevance to a given job description. The system helps recruiters and hiring teams shortlist candidates efficiently by reducing manual screening effort and bias.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an intelligent resume screening system that:

* Analyzes resumes and job descriptions
* Measures similarity between them
* Ranks resumes based on relevance and skill match

## Problem Statement

Manual resume screening is time-consuming and subjective. Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single role, making it difficult to quickly identify the most suitable candidates. This project addresses this problem using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Methodology

* Collected resumes and job descriptions in text/PDF format
* Performed text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal)
* Converted text data into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization
* Calculated similarity scores using cosine similarity
* Ranked resumes based on similarity scores with the job description

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Key Features

* Automated resume screening
* Relevance-based ranking system
* Scalable for multiple resumes and job roles
* Reduces human bias in initial screening

## Outcome

The system successfully ranks resumes according to job relevance, helping identify top candidates efficiently. This project demonstrates practical application of data science, NLP, and machine learning in recruitment automation.

## Future Enhancements

* Skill extraction using Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* Support for PDF and DOCX resume uploads
* Integration with a web-based interface
* Advanced models like BERT for semantic matching

## Use Case

* HR teams and recruiters
* Campus placement shortlisting
* Automated ATS (Applicant Tracking System) screening
